# Create Meta-Synthesis Across Discovery Cycles

Please analyze multiple discovery cycles to identify patterns, contradictions, and strategic insights.

## Purpose

A meta-synthesis connects insights across discovery cycles to:
- Identify persistent themes and patterns
- Track how understanding has evolved
- Spot contradictions that need resolution
- Uncover strategic opportunities
- Guide product direction and prioritization

## When to Create a Meta-Synthesis

- **Quarterly**: Every 3 months to review all cycles
- **Thematic**: When multiple cycles explored related topics
- **Pre-planning**: Before roadmap planning sessions
- **Validation**: When a pattern appears across cycles

## Context Files to Review

Required:
- All synthesis documents from the cycles being analyzed (in `product/discovery/*/synthesis-*.md`)
- `product/requirements/stories-by-cycle.md` (to see how insights translated to requirements)

For context:
- `product/context/product-overview.md`
- `product/context/target-users.md`

## Instructions

1. **Identify cycles to analyze**
   - List all cycles in scope (date range, thematic group, or all cycles)
   - Note the focus of each cycle

2. **Extract themes from each synthesis**
   - Read the "Key Themes" section from each synthesis
   - Create a master list of all themes

3. **Identify cross-cycle patterns**
   - Which themes appear in multiple cycles?
   - How has understanding of each theme evolved?
   - What new insights emerged from later cycles?

4. **Find contradictions**
   - Where do cycles disagree?
   - Can contradictions be explained by context, segment, or timing?
   - What needs further validation?

5. **Track assumption validation**
   - Which assumptions were confirmed?
   - Which were invalidated?
   - How did this change product direction?

6. **Identify emerging opportunities**
   - What strategic insights emerge from connecting cycles?
   - What opportunities weren't visible in single cycles?

7. **Make recommendations**
   - Product direction guidance
   - Feature prioritization insights
   - Future research needs

## Output Location

Save to: `product/discovery/meta-synthesis/meta-[TIMEPERIOD-OR-THEME].md`

Examples:
- `meta-2025-q1.md` (quarterly review)
- `meta-mobile-experience.md` (thematic across mobile-focused cycles)
- `meta-onboarding-evolution.md` (tracking one area over time)

## Output Format

Use the template at: `product/discovery/meta-synthesis/meta-synthesis-template.md`

## Analysis Checklist

- [ ] All relevant cycles are included
- [ ] Cross-cycle themes are identified with references to specific cycles
- [ ] Theme evolution is tracked chronologically
- [ ] Contradictions are noted and analyzed
- [ ] Assumptions are categorized as validated/invalidated/unknown
- [ ] Strategic opportunities are identified
- [ ] Recommendations are evidence-based
- [ ] Research gaps are clearly articulated
- [ ] Feature priority guidance includes rationale

## Success Criteria

A good meta-synthesis:
- Reveals patterns not visible in individual cycles
- Provides strategic product direction guidance
- Identifies what's been validated vs. what needs more research
- Connects dots between seemingly separate findings
- Guides future discovery priorities
- Helps with roadmap planning and prioritization

## Example Usage

**Quarterly review:**
```bash
claude-code --context product/discovery/2025-01-*/synthesis-*.md \
  --context product/discovery/2025-02-*/synthesis-*.md \
  --context product/discovery/2025-03-*/synthesis-*.md \
  --context product/requirements/stories-by-cycle.md \
  product/prompts/create-meta-synthesis.md
```

**Thematic analysis:**
```bash
claude-code --context product/discovery/*-mobile-*/synthesis-*.md \
  --context product/discovery/*-tablet-*/synthesis-*.md \
  --context product/requirements/stories-by-cycle.md \
  product/prompts/create-meta-synthesis.md
```

## Post-Meta-Synthesis Actions

1. Share with product/leadership team
2. Use insights for roadmap planning
3. Identify priority gaps for next discovery cycles
4. Update product strategy documentation if major insights emerged
5. Consider whether any existing stories need re-prioritization
