## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
[Describe the core problem your product addresses. Be specific about the pain points.]

**Example:**
> Remote teams struggle to maintain clear visibility into who's working on what, leading to duplicated effort, missed dependencies, and frustration.

### Who experiences this problem?
[Define your target users. Be specific about roles, company sizes, industries, etc.]

**Example:**
> Engineering teams of 5-50 people at fast-growing startups and scale-ups, particularly those working across multiple time zones.

### Current alternatives/workarounds
[What do people do today to solve this problem? What are the limitations of current solutions?]

**Example:**
> Teams use combinations of Jira, Slack, and spreadsheets, but information is fragmented and requires manual coordination. Asana and Monday.com offer project management but lack intelligent automation.

## Solution Overview
[Describe how your product solves the problem. Focus on the core value proposition, not feature lists.]

**Example:**
> TaskFlow Pro uses AI to automatically break down complex projects into manageable tasks, intelligently assign work based on team capacity and skills, and proactively identify blockers before they impact delivery.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
[List technical limitations, requirements, or decisions that constrain the solution]

**Examples:**
- Must integrate with existing Jira/GitHub workflows

### Business Constraints
[List business limitations or requirements]

**Examples:**
- Bootstrap budget: $50K for MVP
- Launch target: Q2 2025
- Team size: 2 engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM
- Must be profitable by month 18

### Key Assumptions
[List assumptions you're making that need validation]

**Examples:**

- Engineering managers have budget authority for tools <$1K/month
- Integration with existing tools is more important than standalone features
- AI task suggestions will be accurate enough to trust (>80%)

## Out of Scope (for now)
[List what you're explicitly NOT building in the near term]

**Examples:**
- Native mobile apps (mobile web only)
- White-labeling or multi-tenant features
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with Microsoft ecosystem (Teams, Azure DevOps)
- Video conferencing features
