# Overview

A collection of rules that may be useful.

- Be opinionated
- Be brief
- Be specific
- Break down rules and prompts so as to avoid adding unnecessary context

# Rules

Like [Awesome Cursor rules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules), except some level of curation and review

# Contributing New Rules

To contribute new rules:

1. Use the template format in `product/templates/rule-template.md`. Generate rules with a meta-prompt like:
   ```
   Please generate me a new rule formatted according to product/templates/rule-template.md that summarises the principles of [topic/methodology] in under 200 lines.
   ```
