# Product Backlog

**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Overview

Master index of all stories that have been created but not yet built. Stories are added when created via `/req` and removed when released via `/rel`.

## Backlog

| ID | Title | Priority | Iteration |
|----|-------|----------|-----------|
| STORY-XXX | [Story title] | [Priority] | [iteration-name] |
| STORY-YYY | [Story title] | [Priority] | [iteration-name] |

---

## Notes

- Stories are added to backlog when created via `/req`
- Stories are removed from backlog when built and released via `/rel`
- Full story details (acceptance criteria, estimates, etc.) are in the story files
- Iteration reflects where discovery/specification happened, not when it will be built
