description: Extract user stories from iteration synthesis
---

You are being asked to extract user stories from a completed iteration synthesis.

# Overview

This command orchestrates the requirements extraction workflow by reading the canonical prompt instructions and executing them.

# Workflow Steps

## 1. Record Start Time
- Capture the current timestamp as the operation start time
- This will be used for timing metrics

## 2. Identify the Iteration
- Check if the user specified an iteration name (e.g., "2025-11-12-mvp")
- If not specified, look in `product/iterations/` for the most recent iteration (by date prefix)
- Ask the user to clarify if there are multiple recent iterations

## 3. Verify Synthesis Exists and Identify Most Recent
- Check that `product/iterations/{iteration-name}/discovery/synthesis/` directory exists
- If multiple synthesis files exist, identify the MOST RECENT by date
- Use ONLY the most recent synthesis file (older files are historical record only)
- If no synthesis found, inform the user they need to run `/synth` first
- Read the most recent synthesis document to understand the capabilities and requirements

## 4. Determine Story Numbering
- Scan all `product/iterations/*/stories/` directories to find the highest existing story number
- New stories should start at the next sequential number (e.g., if last is STORY-044, start at STORY-045)

## 5. Review Design Artifacts
- Check if `product/iterations/{iteration-name}/design/` directory exists
- If it exists, review all screenshots and design files
- Design screens often represent individual stories
- Screenshots should be referenced in story files

## 6. Read the Story Extraction Prompts
**Read and follow the instructions in**:
- `product/prompts/extract-user-stories.md` - For extracting stories from synthesis and design

This prompt contains the canonical instructions for:
- How to convert synthesis capabilities into user stories
- How to incorporate design screens as stories
- How to write Given-When-Then acceptance criteria
- How to use general personas (not specific stakeholder names)
- How to focus on business requirements while including obvious technical needs
- How to assign priorities and estimates
- How to identify dependencies
- What quality checks to include
- Story format and size based on development approach (LLM vs human)

## 7. Execute Story Extraction
Follow the instructions from the prompts to create the stories.

**Key requirements:**
- Use appropriate story template based on development approach:
  - `product/templates/story-template-llm-dev.md` for LLM-centric development
  - `product/templates/story-template-human-dev.md` for human-centric development
- Include product context from `product/context/`
- Review BOTH synthesis capabilities AND design screens for story creation
- Reference screenshots in stories where design artifacts exist
- Use general personas appropriate to your product (not specific stakeholder names)
- Focus on business requirements with obvious technical needs included
- Ensure sequential story numbering across all iterations
- Follow Given-When-Then format for acceptance criteria

## 8. Save Stories
- Stories are saved to `product/iterations/{iteration-name}/stories/`
- Save each story as `story-{number}-{slug}.md`
- Create or update `product/iterations/{iteration-name}/stories/stories-index.md` with:
  - List of all stories in this iteration
  - Summary of priorities
  - Total effort estimate

## 9. Record Timing and Report Results
- Capture the end timestamp
- Calculate duration in seconds
- Read or create `timing.json` in the iteration directory
- Add this operation to the operations array:
  ```json
  {
    "command": "/req",
    "start": "{start_timestamp_ISO8601}",
    "end": "{end_timestamp_ISO8601}",
    "duration_seconds": {duration},
    "status": "success",
    "metadata": {
      "stories_created": {count},
      "story_ids": ["STORY-XXX", "STORY-YYY"]
    }
  }
  ```
- Update total_duration_seconds
- Append to global timing log at `product/artifacts/timing-log.jsonl`:
  ```json
  {"timestamp": "{end_timestamp}", "command": "/req", "iteration": "{iteration-name}", "duration_seconds": {duration}, "status": "success", "metadata": {"stories_created": {count}}}
  ```
- Tell the user:
  - Story extraction is complete
  - List all stories created with their IDs, titles, and priorities
  - Summary: X stories (Y must have, Z should have, etc.)
  - Estimated total effort
  - The operation duration
  - Next steps: Stories can be mapped with `/map`, loaded to Jira with `/jira`, or sent directly to development

# Important Notes

- **The prompt file is the source of truth** for extraction logic
- Users can customize story extraction by editing `product/prompts/extract-user-stories.md`
- This command handles workflow orchestration (finding files, numbering, timing, saving output)
- The prompt handles the actual extraction logic and story format
- Epics have been removed - stories are the atomic units
- Stories stay in their iteration directory (not moved to backlog until after build)
- DO NOT automatically load stories to Jira - that's a separate workflow (`/jira`)
- Story numbering is sequential across all iterations, not per-iteration
